## **üí¨ How to Use:**

Just tell the AI what you want in natural language!

```
USER: "Keep only from second 20 to second 30"
AI: "Got it! I'm trimming the clip to keep only the part from 20 to 30 seconds. 
     That's a 10-second clip!"
     ‚úÖ [ACTUALLY TRIMS THE VIDEO]
```

```
USER: "Remove the first 15 seconds"
AI: "Removing the first 15 seconds from your clip right now!"
     ‚úÖ [ACTUALLY REMOVES IT]
```

```
USER: "Undo that trim"
AI: "Restoring your clip back to its original full length!"
     ‚úÖ [RESTORES ORIGINAL]
```

## **üîß Technical Details:**

### **How It Works:**

1. **Original Duration Preserved**: When you first trim a clip, the AI saves the original duration
2. **Non-Destructive**: You can always restore back to the original
3. **Smart Timeline**: Subsequent clips automatically adjust their positions
4. **Multiple Modes**: AI intelligently picks the right trim mode based on your command

### **Trim Modes:**

| Mode | Params | Example Command |
|------|--------|-----------------|
| **Range** | `startTrim`, `endTrim` | "Keep from 20s to 30s" |
| **Remove Start** | `startTrim` | "Remove first 10s" |
| **Trim Duration** | `newDuration` | "Trim to 15 seconds" |
| **Keep Only** | `endTrim` | "Keep only first 20s" |
| **Restore** | `restore: true` | "Undo trim" |

## **üé¨ Real-World Examples:**

### **Scenario 1: Perfect Cut**
```
1. "Add my video to the timeline"
2. "Keep only from second 45 to second 75"
   ‚Üí AI extracts exactly 30 seconds
3. "Actually, restore it"
   ‚Üí AI brings back the full clip
4. "Now keep from second 30 to second 90"
   ‚Üí AI extracts the new 60-second range
```

### **Scenario 2: Remove Intro**
```
1. "Add my video"
2. "Remove the first 20 seconds"
   ‚Üí AI cuts off the intro
3. "Perfect! Now trim to 60 seconds total"
   ‚Üí AI keeps only the first 60s of the remaining clip
```

### **Scenario 3: Trial and Error**
