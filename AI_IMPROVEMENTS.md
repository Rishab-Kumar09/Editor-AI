## **🤖 AI IMPROVEMENTS:**

### **2. NO MORE "MEH" RESPONSES!**

**Before (MEH):**
```
User: "trim the video to 10 secs"
AI: "Currently, I don't have the ability to trim videos to a specific length..."
```
❌ Useless! Frustrating!

**After (HELPFUL):**
```
User: "trim the video to 10 secs"
AI: "Here's how to trim your video: Click on the clip in the timeline, 
     then drag the trim handles (edges) to adjust the length. 
     You can see the duration in the bottom corner!"
```
✅ Actionable! Helpful! BETTER!

### **3. SMART IMAGE HANDLING**

**Your Request:**
> "when i say add images and my project doesn't have enough images, it should ask me if i want only images from the ones i uploaded or find some from internet"

**Implementation:**

```
User: "add some images"

AI: "I'd love to help! Do you want me to:
     
     1. Use only the images you've uploaded
     2. Search the internet for images that match your video's content
     
     I can even analyze your video to find the perfect images!"
```

✅ AI now asks for your preference!  
✅ Mentions internet search capability  
✅ Offers video content analysis

- Understands what the video is about
- Finds matching images from internet (Unsplash)
- Places them at the right moments

**Example:**
```
User: "add images based on what my video talks about"

     and add relevant images at the right moments! 
     Give me a moment to process the video..."
